To compile against the vernier sdk on OSX 10.3.9 cc-tools must be installed from gnu.  
I just downloaded the latest version from here: 
ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/infrastructure/
As far as I can tell this is because of incompibilities between different versions of gcc.  And
the current vernier sdk was compiled with a newer version than what is available on 10.3.9
